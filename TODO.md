To do
=====

*  `group_fs` and `tree_fs` does not work in Python 3 and will require further investigation. 
*  Integration the appropriate `feature_selection` within `scikit-learn` has probably broken sparse filter algorithms
*  tests should be refactored by "type" of feature selection (e.g. all supervised, all unsupervised etc)
